The sonic brainchild of Shawn Cummins, Whenuknow first came to conception as an unadulterated outlet of expression. Already having familiarized and immersed himself into the craft of production through synthesizers and DAWs such as Ableton, along with a considerable background in music prior, it wasn’t until the artist confronted mortality itself that the project took flight. After firsthand experiencing a school shooting at the University of North Carolina in 2019, Cummins vowed to be headstrong in his emblazoned pursuit of music; unbeknownst that he'd result in not only keeping his promise to himself, but going on to surpass it.

Since then, the Charlotte based producer has taken strides within the electronic music community, honing in on a trademark sound in electro house. Showcasing time-honored elements with bold basslines and four on the floor cadence, he introduces a more modern flair, bordering the line between bouncy bass house and midtempo. His contemporary, distinct synth-soaked sound led him to landing an official remix for the trance trailblazer Mat Zo on Anjunabeats, shortly followed up with releases on renowned labels among the likes of Night Bass, Space Yacht, Gold Digger Records, and Box of Cats.

Between an impressive discography and touring history of danceable performances supporting acclaimed artists such as i_o, Wax Motif, Habstrakt, Dada Life, Jason Ross, and more, he continues to garner attention from widespread audiences. All the while staying true to his course, Whenuknow indubitably warrants his forward-facing positioning at the crux of the house scene.
